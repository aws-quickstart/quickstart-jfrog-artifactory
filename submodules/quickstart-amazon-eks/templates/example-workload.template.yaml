Description: "deploy an example workload into an existing kubernetes cluster"
Parameters:
  KubeManifestLambdaArn:
    Type: String
  HelmLambdaArn:
    Type: String
  KubeClusterName:
    Type: String
  NodeInstanceProfile:
    Type: String
Resources:
  # This resource creates a ConfigMap in the target cluster. It retrieves and decrypts a kms encrypted
  # kubernetes config file, which is automatically created when customers deploy an EKS cluster with the quickstart,
  # for bring-your-own-cluster the customer must encrypt and upload a config file prior to launching the stack.
  #
  # The "URL" property is an exact representation of a regular kubernetes resource manifest, available by link
  KubeManifestURLExample:
    Type: "Custom::KubeManifest"
    Version: '1.0'
    Properties:
      # The lambda function that executes the manifest against the cluster. This is created in one of the parent stacks
      ServiceToken: !Ref KubeManifestLambdaArn
      ClusterName: !Ref KubeClusterName
      # Kubernetes manifest URL
      Url: https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

  # The "Manifest" property is an exact representation of a regular kubernetes resource manifest, on stack create
  # `kubectl create --save-config` is called, on stack update `kubectl apply` and on stack delete `kubectl delete`
  #
  # The following elements are available to be used in other cloudformation resources using !GetAtt:
  # name, namespace, resourceVersion, selfLink, uid

    Properties:

        kind: ConfigMap
        metadata:
          # If name is not specified it will be automatically generated,
          # and can be retrieved with !GetAtt LogicalID.name
          #
          # name: test
          #
          # if namespace is not specified, "default" namespace will be used

        data:
          # examples of consuming outputs of the HelmExample resource below's output. Creates an implicit dependency, so
          # this resource will only launch once the HelmExample resource has completed successfully
          ServiceCatalogReleaseName: !Ref HelmExample
          ServiceCatalogKubernetesServiceName: !GetAtt HelmExample.Service0
  # This resource deploys the kubernetes service catalog from it's helm chart.
  #
  # using !GetAtt you can fetch Name (release name) and Namespace, as well as all of the created resources, who's keys
  # are the resource type + an index for the case where a chart creates more than 1 of a Kind (eg. ConfigMap0 fetches
  # the 1st ConfigMap created)
  HelmExample:
    Type: "Custom::Helm"
    Version: '1.0'
    Properties:
      ServiceToken: !Ref HelmLambdaArn
      ClusterName: !Ref KubeClusterName
      # If the chart is not in the stable repo then supply a repo url
      RepoUrl: https://svc-catalog-charts.storage.googleapis.com
      # namespace is optional, in most cases it's best to leave this out so that a namespace is dynamically generated.
      # If namespace does not exist it will be created
      #
      # Namespace: example-ns
      #
      # supply chart name in "repo-name/chart-name" or "https://repo-hostname/repo-path/chart-package.tgz"
      Chart: svc-cat/catalog
      # Name can be specified, if not helm will generate one
      # Name: myRelease
      # Version can be specified, if not latest will be used
      # Version: 1.0.1
      # Custom values can optionally be specified
      Values:
        apiserver.healthcheck.enabled: true
        imagePullPolicy: Always
      # If there are a lot of values, or they contain ambiguous types (eg, enable: "true" or count: "1") then values can
      # be passed as yaml enclosed in a string literal
