. On the *Outputs* tab of the JFrog Artifactory stack in the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation console], find `ArtifactoryURL`. Connect to JFrog Artifactory using `ArtifactoryURL`.

NOTE: If you use a non-CA-signed certificate, you will see a certificate warning when you attempt to access the JFrog Artifactory URL. You can click through the warning to continue to the page. This warning displays when the certificate does not match the Elastic Load Balancer DNS (Domain Name System). As an option, you can configure Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service to avoid seeing this warning.

. On the *Set Base URL* page, you can configure an optional base URL setting. Because this deployment uses a proxy, it's highly recommended that you set the JFrog Artifactory base URL. For more information, see https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Configuring+Artifactory#ConfiguringArtifactory-GeneralSettings[Configuring Artifactory^].

. On the *Configure Platform Default Proxy* page, you can configure optional proxy settings for remote resources.
