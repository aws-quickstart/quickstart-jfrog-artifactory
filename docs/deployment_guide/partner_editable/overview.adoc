This Quick Start deploys https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[JFrog Artifactory]—and, optionally, https://jfrog.com/xray/[JFrog Xray]—in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. If you are unfamiliar with AWS Quick Starts we recommend that you read the https://aws-ia.github.io/content/qs_info.html[AWS Quick Start General Content Guide].

// This deployment guide covers the steps necessary to deploy the Quick Start. For more advanced information on the product, troubleshooting, or additional functionality, see the https://{quickstart-github-org}.github.io/{quickstart-project-name}/operational/index.html[Operational guide].

The default installation creates two https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^] groups:

* The first Auto Scaling group ensures that the `node.id` for high availability (HA) is set to `primary` and that there is always only one primary node.
* The second Auto Scaling group ensures that the `node.id` for the secondary nodes is unique and sets this `node.id` to the hostname. This Auto Scaling group scales up or down the number of secondary nodes to the amount specified by the administrator.

The optional JFrog Xray installation creates two additional Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups:

* The first Auto Scaling group is responsible for the primary node. JFrog Xray is installed into the primary subnet. 
* The second Auto Scaling group installs JFrog Xray into the secondary subnet. This Auto Scaling group scales up or down the number of secondary nodes to the amount specified by the administrator.

The Network Load Balancer monitors the Auto Scaling groups and is configured with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html[health checks^] that validate that the JFrog Artifactory service is up and running. If the endpoint returns an error response, a new node is recovered within 10 minutes.
