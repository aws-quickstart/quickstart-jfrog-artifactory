After deploying this Partner Solution, you can use JFrog Artifactory and JFrog Xray as a production service. For more information about setting up JFrog Artifactory after Partner Solution deployment, see <<#_get_started_with_JFrog_Artifactory, Get started with JFrog_Artifactory>>, later in this guide.

WARNING:  The deployment is configured as infrastructure as code. Any changes to the infrastructure should be done by updating the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html[CloudFormation stack^]. Any changes performed on the boxes themselves (including reverse-proxy configurations) are lost when an instance reboots. By design, upon shutdown of an instance, or when JFrog Artifactory is unavailable, an Auto Scaling group replaces the node, following a load-balancing health check.
