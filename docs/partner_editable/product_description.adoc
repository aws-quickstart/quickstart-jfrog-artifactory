Once you deploy JFrogâ€™s Artifactory with the option to install Xray, you can use it as a production service. For more
information about setting up Artifactory, see the <<#_get_started_with_JFrog_Artifactory, Get started with JFrog_Artifactory>> section
later in this guide.

WARNING:  The deployment is configured as _infrastructure as code_. Any changes
to the infrastructure should be done by updating the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html[CloudFormation stack^]. Any
changes performed on the boxes themselves (including reverse-proxy
configurations) are lost when an instance reboots. By design, upon shutdown of an
instance, or when Artifactory is unavailable, an Auto Scaling group replaces the
node, following a load-balancing health check.
