===== Prepare the certificate and certificate key

Open the certificate into an editor of your choice and copy the certificate and paste it directly in the text box in next step. This results in the entire certificate being on a single line, and it automatically converts all Carriage Return and Line Feed (CRLF) or Line Feed (LF) characters to spaces.
Follow the same process for the certificate key.


===== Add the license keys and certificate to AWS Secrets Manager

Perform these steps:

. Open AWS Secrets Manager in the same Region in which you deploy the Quick Start.
. Choose *Store a new secret*.
. Choose *Other type of secret*.
. For the secret key value, create six rows for the Artifactory licenses.
. Add the following key names and Artifactory license keys (see <<secret_manager_licenses>>):

* *ArtifactoryLicense1*
* *ArtifactoryLicense2*
* *ArtifactoryLicense3*
* *ArtifactoryLicense4*
* *ArtifactoryLicense5*
* *ArtifactoryLicense6*

===== Subscribe to the CentOS AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for CentOS in AWS Marketplace.

Perform the following steps:

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. {marketplace_listing_url}[Open the page for the CentOS AMI in AWS Marketplace], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplace â€” the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.
