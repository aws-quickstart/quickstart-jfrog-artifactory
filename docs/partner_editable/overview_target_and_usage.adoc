This Quick Start deploys https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[JFrog Artifactory]—and, optionally, https://jfrog.com/xray/[JFrog Xray]—in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. JFrog Artifactory is a universal artifact repository that can manage over 30 different package types throughout the application development lifecycle. As the single source of truth for your binaries, JFrog Artifactory speeds up the software release cycles for your deployments. JFrog Xray works with JFrog Artifactory to scan your packages for security vulnerabilities at each stage of your DevOps pipeline.

By deploying JFrog on AWS, you gain the security and scalability of AWS services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). With Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can redeploy, scale up, or scale down your JFrog Artifactory and JFrog Xray nodes as needed. This Quick Start reference architecture uses AWS Elastic Load Balancing to deliver JFrog Artifactory and JFrog Xray with high availability.

The default installation creates two https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^] groups:

* The first Auto Scaling group is responsible for the primary node and ensures that the `node.id` for high availability (HA) is set to `primary` and that there is always only one primary node.
* The second Auto Scaling group is responsible for ensuring that the `node.id` for the secondaries is unique and therefore sets it to the hostname. This Auto Scaling group is
also responsible for scaling up or down the number of secondaries to the amount specified by the administrator.

The optional JFrog Xray installation creates two additional Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups:

* The first Auto Scaling group is responsible for the primary node. JFrog Xray is installed into the primary subnet. 
* The second Auto Scaling group is responsible installing Xray into the secondary subnet. This Auto Scaling group is also responsible for scaling up or down the number of secondaries to the amount specified by the administrator.

The Auto Scaling groups are monitored by the Network Load Balancer, which is configured with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html[health checks^] that validate that the JFrog Artifactory service is up and running. If the endpoint returns an error response, a new node is recovered within 10 minutes.
