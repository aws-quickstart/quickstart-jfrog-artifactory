// Include details about the license and how they can sign up. If no license is required, clarify that. 

// These two paragraphs provide an example of the details you can provide. Provide links as appropriate.


// Example content below:

// _<license information>This Partner Solution requires a license for {partner-product-name}. To use the Partner Solution in your production environment, sign up for a license at <link>. When you launch the Partner Solution, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location._

// _If you don’t have a license, the Partner Solution deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you <n> days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions at <link>._

// // Or, if the deployment uses an AMI, update this paragraph. If it doesn’t, remove the paragraph.
// _<AMI information>The Partner Solution requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for {partner-product-name}, which is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace^]. Additional pricing, terms, and conditions may apply. For instructions, see link:#step-2.-subscribe-to-the-software-ami[step 2] in the deployment section._


This Partner Solution requires a subscription to the CentOS AMI and an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license for JFrog Artifactory. Subscribe to the CentOS AMI on the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW?ref_=aws-mp-console-subscription-detail[AWS CentOS Marketplace^] page. If you choose to install JFrog Xray, you must have an Enterprise+ license or an Enterprise license with the JFrog Xray add-on.

To use the Partner Solution in your production environment, sign up for a https://jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial-aws/#enterprise[free trial JFrog license^], which includes three JFrog Artifactory Enterprise licenses. Add the license keys to AWS Secrets Manager, as described in the <<#_deployment_steps, Deployment steps>> section in this guide. 

NOTE: JFrog Enterprise or Enterprise+ licenses are required to ensure high availability. Partner Solution deployment will fail if the license is not an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license, the license is invalid, or the license is not specified during deployment. Ensure that the number of secondary JFrog Artifactory servers is at most the amount licensed minus one, for the primary server. If you specify too many servers, see the <<FAQ>> section for instructions.

If you start with a free trial JFrog license, contact https://jfrog.com/pricing/[JFrog^] to obtain a permanent license before the trial period ends. Otherwise, nodes become unresponsive after the free trial period ends.
