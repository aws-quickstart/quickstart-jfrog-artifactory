// Include details about the license and how they can sign up. If no license is required, clarify that. 

// These two paragraphs provide an example of the details you can provide. Provide links as appropriate.


// Example content below:

// _<license information>This Quick Start requires a license for {partner-product-name}. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, sign up for a license at <link>. When you launch the Quick Start, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location._

// _If you don’t have a license, the Quick Start deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you <n> days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions at <link>._

// // Or, if the deployment uses an AMI, update this paragraph. If it doesn’t, remove the paragraph.
// _<AMI information>The Quick Start requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for {partner-product-name}, which is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace^]. Additional pricing, terms, and conditions may apply. For instructions, see link:#step-2.-subscribe-to-the-software-ami[step 2] in the deployment section._


This Quick Start requires a subscription to the CentOS AMIand an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license for Artifactory. You can subscribe to the CentOS AMI on the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW?ref_=aws-mp-console-subscription-detail[AWS CentOS Marketplace^] page. If you choose to install Xray, you must have an Enterprise+ license or an Enterprise license with the Xray add-on.

To use the Quick Start in your production environment, sign up for a https://jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial-aws/#enterprise[free trial license^], which includes three Artifactory Enterprise licenses. Add the license keys to AWS Secrets Manager, as described in the <<#_deployment_steps, Deployment steps>> section in this guide. 

NOTE: Enterprise or Enterprise+ licenses are required for high availability. If the license isn’t an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license, the license is invalid,
or the license is not included, the deployment will fail. Also, ensure that the number
of secondary Artifactory servers is at most the amount licensed minus one, for the
primary server. If you specify too many servers, see the <<FAQ>> section for instructions.

If you use a free trial, convert to a permanent license before your trial ends,
otherwise the nodes will become unresponsive. You can request a quote by contacting
