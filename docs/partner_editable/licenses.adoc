// Include details about the license and how they can sign up. If no license is required, clarify that.

// Example content below:

// _<license information>This Quick Start requires a license for {partner-product-name}. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, sign up for a license at <link>. When you launch the Quick Start, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location._

// _If you don’t have a license, the Quick Start deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you <n> days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions at <link>._

// // Or, if the deployment uses an AMI, update this paragraph. If it doesn’t, remove the paragraph.
// _<AMI information>The Quick Start requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for {partner-product-name}, which is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace^].

This Quick Start requires an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license for Artifactory. It also
requires a subscription to the http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B086PTRY8G[JFrog Enterprise EC2 (Enterprise Artifact Repository, SelfHosted)^] Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace[AWS Marketplace^]. To use the Quick Start in
your production environment, sign up for a https://jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial-aws/#enterprise[free trial license^], which includes three
Artifactory Enterprise licenses. Place the license keys in the specified fields when you
launch the Quick Start. Enterprise or Enterprise+ licenses are required due to the following
features of this deployment:

* High availability
* Storing S3 objects

NOTE: If the license isn’t an Enterprise or Enterprise+ license, the license is invalid,
or the license is not included, the deployment will fail. Also, ensure that the number
of secondary Artifactory servers is at most the amount licensed minus one, for the
primary server. If you specify too many servers, see the <<FAQ>> section for instructions.

If you use a free trial, ensure that you convert to a permanent license before your trial ends,
otherwise the nodes will become unresponsive. You can request a quote by contacting
